    <p>
      Welcome to my website. I keep things simple here, and that also includes how I handle your privacy.  
      This Privacy Policy is written in plain words so you know exactly what to expect when you visit my blog.
    </p>

    <h3>1. No Tracking, No Ads</h3>
    <p>
      I don’t run ads and I don’t use third-party trackers. Your visit here stays private.
    </p>

    <h3>2. What I Collect</h3>
    <p>
      I don’t ask for personal data unless you choose to contact me. If you send me an email, I’ll only use it to reply.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Cookies</h3>
    <p>
      I only use simple, functional cookies (if any). Never for tracking, just to keep the site working smoothly.
    </p>

    <h3>4. External Links</h3>
    <p>
      I sometimes link to other websites. Once you leave my site, their rules apply, not mine.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Your Choice</h3>
    <p>
      By continuing to use this site, you accept this policy. If you don’t agree, you’re free to leave anytime.
