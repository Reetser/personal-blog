<h2>Who Am I</h2>
<p>Howdy! How are you? I'm Resteer John L. Lumbab — the owner and creator of this website. 
I’m 24 years old and currently living in the Philippines.</p>

<h2>Why Did I Build This Website?</h2>
<p>I wanted to have my own personal space on the web. 
Sure, social media exists, but I believe having my own website is a stronger foundation for building my online presence. 
Here, I’m in full control — no fear of being banned, censored, or restricted by someone else’s rules.</p>

<h2>Everything I Need Is Within</h2>
<p>If I want to post images — I can.  
Text? Absolutely.  
Videos? No problem.  
This website may not be as powerful as big social media platforms, but it caters to my needs and even goes beyond that.  
I can post anything I want, and I can delete anything I choose — complete freedom, in my own space.</p>

<h2>What to Expect Here</h2>
<p>On this website, you’ll find a mix of my personal thoughts, projects, and discoveries. 
Sometimes I’ll share guides or resources I’ve learned from experience, other times I might just post something creative or experimental. 
It’s a place where I can freely express myself without worrying about trends, algorithms, or outside control.</p>

  <h2>Lost Thyself</h2>
<p>I'm Human, Not A Robot<br>
I'm Not AI, I'm A Man<br>
I don't know what to Write, I do Write<br>
I don't know what to Create, I do Create<br>
I don't know Anything, I know Something</p>

<p>I'm Broke, I have coins<br>
I'm in Debt, I'm out of Breath<br>
I'm Living, I'm Surviving<br>
I don't know what to do, I do<br>
I'm Lost, I take paths<br>
I'm not Alone, I'm Lone</p>

<p>I Cried, I laugh<br>
I hate my flows, I recreate my flaws<br>
I'm Walking Around, Going Round And Round</p>

<p>I run away, But Find Myself Again<br>
I wake Up, Keep Waking Up<br>
I'm Aware, Found thyself nowhere<br>
I have many many foods, can't finish one<br>
I'm Returning, Hardly can't escape</p>

<p>I want to change, Find thyself Again<br>
I want to change, Find thyself Again<br>
I want to change, Find thyself Again</p>

<p>I do change, Find thyself Again<br>
I do change, Find thyself Again<br>
I do change, Find thyself Again</p>

<p>I'm Sick And Tired, I drink vitamins<br>
I'm Sick And Tired, I'm Sick<br>
I'm Sick And Tired, I'm Tired<br>
I'm Sick And Tired, Fooling Thyself</p>

<p>Lost Thyself</p>
</dev>
